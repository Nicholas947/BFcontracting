            At B&F Contracting, Inc. we understand the importance of choosing the right
             contract delivery method for your project. Different methods offer 
             diverse benefits and drawbacks, and we have the expertise to help 
             determine the best approach for your specific needs.<br><br>
            When considering the different procurement methods it is 
            important to always keep in mind “Best Value” which is a 
            combination of price, quality schedule and most importantly a 
            team effort delivering to the owner the best of all these 
            various facets of the project. The owner would typically 
            determine best value which may be unique from one owner and 
            project to the next.  Low price may be a high priority or 
            possibly an accelerated schedule along with quality could be 
            more important.

        <p style="padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;">
         Sometimes referred to as “Hard Bid” or “Low Bid” is a common and popular procurement approach. With this method, 
         the owner hires a designer to create plans and specifications, and then invites contractors to bid on the project. 
         Typically, pricing on the job is submitted confidentially and the lowest priced bidder expects to get the contract.
        The DBB method is straightforward and allows for competitive bidding but may result in potential conflicts between the 
        designer and contractor. There is a possibility for discrepancies in the plans and specifications which may result in the 
        contractor requesting more money once the selected. This occurs through change orders, which result in a bid price higher than
        the original submittal. Additionally, bidders on publicly funded projects are usually required to supply a bid bond, 
        performance bond, and/or payment bond to guarantee their company’s financial stability. 
        The upside of DBB often is it brings the lowest price. This allows the owner to save on costs and it’s especially beneficial on projects where taxpayer funds are involved. Public agencies are obligated to award the lowest responsive bidder in most cases. On the downside, the lowest bidder often is not the most experienced. Since the contractor is selected solely on price, they may not provide the highest quality, safety, innovative methods, and Best Value.
        B&F has extensive experience with DBB projects and can help navigate potential issues that may arise both prior to the bid date and after the bid.  Even though it is not required in this delivery method, B&F will still provide constructability input as well as budget, schedule, design, and potential value engineering alternatives. These are just a few strategies B&F implements which can add value to your project.

    <!-- JOC -->
    <div class ="popup" id="popupJOC" >
        <h1 style="padding: 20px 0;">JOC</h1>
        <p style="padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;">
            JOC contracts allow for the completion of multiple, small to medium-sized projects 
            within a single procurement contract. This streamlined process saves time, reduces 
            administrative burden, and leads to cost savings.
            JOCs are generally advertised publicly with parameters set on single job limits, 
            cumulative job limits, per year and advertised scope of work. Under a JOC contract,
            a pre-qualified contractor or multiple contractors (generally around 3) are selected 
            to complete a variety of construction projects. These projects may arise for capital 
            improvement or operations and maintenance. Typically, these are a one-year contract 
            with annual extensions of anywhere between one year to five years, but it may vary. 
            As the owner agency, JOCs allow one contract to be approved which can have multiple 
            smaller contracts not subject to going through the approval process again. 
            B&F likes to work directly with the owner to determine goals including budget, 
            schedule, quality expectations, community impact, aesthetics, lifespan, etc.  
            This collaboration between the contractor and the owner results in projects being 
            completed on time, on budget, and to the satisfaction of all parties involved. JOC 
            contracts have become the go-to procurement method for government agencies and 
            organizations that require frequent construction projects. If you're looking for a 
            procurement method on smaller projects that are efficient, cost-effective, and 
            promote collaboration, JOCs may be the procurement method you are looking for. 
            At B&F, we are experts at managing multiple job orders concurrently and have active 
            JOCs with agencies all over Arizona. Our unmatched expertise, quality, and self-performing ability allow us to respond quickly and efficiently to our clients’ job orders.

        <p style="padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;">
            This procurement method brings the contractor in early in the process where the 
            project may still be in the conceptual and design phase. The owner benefits from the 
            contractor’s expertise and input on the design and construction aspects. 
            CMAR is a collaborative approach that results in a more efficient and cost-effective 
            construction process, with reduced risk of change orders and delays. This delivery 
            method offers unmatched benefits to owners, including increased collaboration, reduced
             risk, and improved project outcomes. Contractors are chosen based on their 
             qualifications, which spans from their experience with similar projects to the 
             overall value they can provide to the project. With the construction manager assuming
            the risk for the construction process, owners can have peace of mind knowing that 
            their project is in the most capable hands. CMAR contracts are the perfect solution 
            for projects that require a high level of collaboration and risk management, which in many cases makes them the ultimate procurement method for your construction project! B&F is proud to have worked on many successful CMAR projects. Our expertise and proven CMAR approach will provide valuable insight to your project, ensuring it is completed on time and within budget.
