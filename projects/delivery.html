            At B&F Contracting, Inc. we understand the importance of choosing the right
             contract delivery method for your project. Different methods offer 
             diverse benefits and drawbacks, and we have the expertise to help 
             determine the best approach for your specific needs.<br><br>
            When considering the different procurement methods it is 
            important to always keep in mind “Best Value” which is a 
            combination of price, quality schedule and most importantly a 
            team effort delivering to the owner the best of all these 
            various facets of the project. The owner would typically 
            determine best value which may be unique from one owner and 
            project to the next.  Low price may be a high priority or 
            possibly an accelerated schedule along with quality could be 
            more important.

                <h1>Design Bid Build</h1>

                <p>
                    sometimes referred to as “Hard Bid” or “Low Bid” is a 
                    common and popular approach. With this method, the 
                    owner hires a designer to create plans and 
                    specifications, and then invites contractors to bid on 
                    the project. Typically pricing on the job is submitted
                     confidentially where the lowest priced bidder expects
                      to get the contract. This method is straightforward
                       and allows for competitive bidding but may result
                    in potential conflicts between the designer and
                     contractor. Also, discrepancies in the plans and 
                    specifications may result in the contractor requesting
                    more money through the change order process resulting 
                    in a bid price higher than the original submittal.
                     Bidders on Publicly funded projects are usually
                      required to supply a bid bond and performance and
                       payment bond to guarantee their financial stability.
                        With taxpayer funds involved the agency is obligated
                         in most cases to award the project to the lowest 
                        responsive bidder.<br><br>
                    The upside of DBB often is it brings the lowest price. <br><br>
                    On the downside, the lowest bidder often is not the most experienced and may not provide the 
                    highest quality and Best Value since with this process the contractor 
                    is selected solely on price alone. <br><br>
                    B&F has extensive experience with DBB projects and can help navigate 
                    potential issues that may arise both prior to the bid date and after 
                    the bid.  Even though not required in this procurement method B&F will
                     still provide constructability input as well as budget, schedule 
                     design and potential value engineering alternatives which can add 
                     value to the project.

                <h1>JOC</h1>

                <p>
                    JOC contracts allow for the completion of multiple, small to
                     medium-sized projects within a single contract. This streamlined 
                     process saves time, 
                    reduces administrative burden, and leads to cost savings.<br><br>

                    JOC’s are generally advertised publicly with parameters set on single job limits, cumulative job limits, per year and advertised scope of work.  Under a JOC contract, a pre-qualified contractor or multiple contractors generally around 3 are selected to complete a variety of construction projects which may arise for capital improvement or operations and maintenance. Typically these are a one year contract with annual extensions of up to one year with a total of 3 to 5 years. As the owner agency this allows one contract to be approved which can have multiple smaller contracts not subject to go through the approval process again. This collaboration between the contractor and the agency or organization results in projects being completed on time, on budget, and to the satisfaction of all parties involved. JOC contracts have become the go-to procurement method for government agencies and organizations that require frequent construction projects. If you're looking for a procurement method on smaller projects that are efficient, cost-effective, and promote collaboration, 
                    JOC contracts may be the procurement method you are looking for.<br><br>

                    We also have experience with other contract delivery methods such as design-build and public-private partnerships (PPP). With our expertise and knowledge of different contract delivery methods, we can help you make informed decisions that will ensure the success of your construction project.

                <h1>CMAR</h1>

                <p>
                    this procurement method brings the contractor in early on in the process where the project may still be in the conceptual and design phase.  Owner’s benefit from the contractors’ expertise and input on the design and construction aspects. This collaborative approach results in a more efficient and cost-effective construction process, with reduced risk of change orders and delays. The CMAR approach offers unmatched benefits to owners, including increased collaboration, reduced risk, and improved project outcomes. With the construction manager assuming the risk for the construction process, owners can have peace of mind knowing that their project is in the most capable hands. CMAR contracts are the perfect solution for projects that require a high level of collaboration and risk management, which in many cases makes them the ultimate procurement method for your construction project!  Our team has worked on many successful CMAR projects and can provide valuable insight to ensure your project is completed on time and within budget.

                <h1>Hard Bids</h1>

                <p>
                    This is the ultimate procurement method for cost-conscious owners - 
                    hard bid contracts! With this approach, you can be assured that your 
                    construction project will be completed at the most cost-effective price. 
                    The competitive bidding process ensures that contractors are submitting 
                    their best prices, and you can choose the lowest qualified bidder for maximum
                    savings <br><br>
                    
                    While hard bid contracts prioritize cost savings over 
                    collaboration, they remain a useful procurement method for many projects. 
                    However, it's important to be aware of the potential drawbacks, such as a 
                    lack of collaboration between the owner, design team, and contractor. 
                    Consider whether hard bid contracts are the best fit for your project's 
                    needs and budget. Choose the ultimate cost-effective option for your 
                    construction project - 
                    hard bid contracts are the best in the business!
